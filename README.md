### Nicolas Kruchten

I build data visualization and data analysis tools. I created [Plotly Express](https://plotly.express/) as well as [react-pivottable](https://react-pivottable.js.org/) and [pivottable.js](https://pivottable.js.org/). I am currently a graduate student at the [École de Technologie Supérieure](https://etsmtl.ca/) in Montreal, Canada. I post videos of talks and neat visualization projects at [https://nicolas.kruchten.com/](https://nicolas.kruchten.com/).
